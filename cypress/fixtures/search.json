Destry's life is dedicated to terraforming Sask-E. As part of the Environmental Rescue Team, she cares for the planet and its burgeoning eco-systems as her parents and their parents did before her. But the bright, clean future they're building comes under threat when Destry discovers a city full of people that shouldn’t exist, hidden inside a massive volcano. As she uncovers more about their past, Destry begins to question the mission she's devoted her life to, and must make a choice that will reverberate through Sask-E's future for generations to come. A science fiction epic for our times and a love letter to our future, The Terraformers will take you on a journey spanning thousands of years and exploring the triumphs, strife, and hope that find us wherever we make our home. \"Brilliantly thoughtful, prescient, and gripping.”—Martha Wells, author of The Murderbot Diaries Also by Annalee Newitz Autonomous The Future of Another Timeline At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

Princess Ione has cashed in on playing the party girl for most of her life, but not even an imperial princess can escape the fallout of one too many scandals. Her efforts to repair her reputation have tanked, but she gets one last chance to make good, by planning a charity function for an embattled colony world. If she's going to go from party princess to people's princess, she's going to need all the friends she can get, including the man who could have been her prince, but can now only be her secret. For Den Hades, his rising star comes with a dangerous tail. His father's rage has only grown since Den's one act of defiance ruined his House's chances of alliance with the Imperial House--and kept him away from the princess who captured his heart. Den's rising Social Capital edges him closer to achieving Scionhood and freedom, but his father's influence peels more of Den's friends away. As his friends buckle under pressure from their own Houses to choose sides, his only chance is to find allies among his enemies and keep his secrets closer than ever--including his secret relationship with Ione. It's not the fall that'll kill you...It's the sudden stop at the end.",

The new empires, which have arisen from the rubble of a devastating war, are looking with greedy eyes across the Great Rift to the untouched stars which lie there. Great riches and power will come to those who can control them. Engineer Charles Crawford has been dispatched with Terraformer Regina Nassau and a bold expedition on a ten-year voyage to establish a colony and transport gate on the far side of the Rift. But a rival power is determined to hijack the attempt and has secreted an agent in the expedition to disrupt it with sabotage and murder. With the political and military personnel dead, the task of carrying on falls to the engineers and technicians. Crawford and Nassau must mold the survivors into a force capable of resisting an enemy attack while continuing their primary task of establishing the colony and building the all-important transport gate. Their task is further complicated by the fact that the far side of the Rift is not as uninhabited as it was supposed to be. Refugees from the earlier, destroyed civilization have already made a home here and they look upon the newcomers with decidedly mixed emotions. Crawford and Nassau must try to win the trust of the natives if they are to have any hope against the coming enemy attack.",

When alien scouts terrorize Pauls planet, he and his family work together to engineer a nonlethal battle suit designed to stop the attacks.

He is also the game master of Divine Mighta gladiator game that may represent the Utopians only hope. Using his invented suit, Paul embarks on a journey to gain mercy for his race by conquering the game, in which the champions wish comes true.

But even with their emergency beacon running, no one seemed ready or willing to help them. The politics of the oncoming war has followed them from the space station. Even those that don't know about the war could feel it in the wind of the Terran Alliance. The only way for the group to be rescued was for them to take the dangerous trek across the inhospitable desert, hoping to make it to the terraformed section of the colony. Once saved from their destroyed ship, Dor, Derryl, and Worse resume their original plans, heading to Earth for basic training. Dor's wife, Kenya, had arrived ahead of them, greeting her like the old friend that she was. Only everything isn't the same between them. Not after that kiss. Not after the time apart. Not with Kenya flourishing in training, and Dor falling behind. But at least Dor isn't alone in failing. At least, not at first. But not everything at basic training is on the level. Something is happening in the shadows. A mystery that Dor can't quite figure out. But not for lack of trying. Besides, in space, no one can hear you train.",
