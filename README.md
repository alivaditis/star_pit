## Abstract: 
A website for sci-fi readers that uses the fetch API to get information from the [Google Books Api](https://developers.google.com/books) and render that data. Users can search for sci-fi books, view information for a specific book, and save them to a 'to-read' list. Additionally uses can browse curated lists, which are accessed through the bookshelves enpoint of the Google Books Api.  The app uses network requests to access information about sci-fi books and utilizes react router to create a multi-page experience, tested using Cypress.

## Context: 
- Mod 3, Week 5: 
  - Current student of Turing School of Software & Design. 
  - Turing is a 7 month program, which offers a total of 4 modules. 
  - This project was completed during the third module that the program has to offer. 
  - Students are required to build a project demonstrating their understanding of React, Browser Router, and Cypres fundamentals. 

## Learning Goals:
- Build a React project in 5 days
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Make network requests (using fetch API)
- Further improve React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS with Cypress E2E testing
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
